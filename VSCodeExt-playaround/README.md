# Visual Studio Code Extension development - playaround
Playaround with VSCode extension development following its [official docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension). The project will be changed when I have a new idea for an extension.


## Run
* Open "helloworld" project in VSCode
* Press F5, a new instance of VSCode is run with this extension
* In that instance, run "Hello World" command by Ctrl + Shift + P
* A notification appears
