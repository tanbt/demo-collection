        Diagonal layout based on Lorem IpsumLorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout,
        and printing in place of English to emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or
        filler)
        text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or
        presentation,
        eg typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and
        philosopher
        Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content
        nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's still resembles
        classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z,
        alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of European
        languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.

        In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to be made and
        presented with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled with content hourly
        on the day of going live.

      Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed since the early 1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth
      century.
